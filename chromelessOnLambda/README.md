Tried following the steps on
https://novemberfive.co/blog/visual-regression-testing-jest-chromeless-lambda.

However, got stuck on getting the first sample script to run.  It said something about chromeless not defined in the teardown function.  Need to pulldown their repo at https://github.com/novemberfiveco/visual-regression-testing-jest-chromeless and run the test later.
